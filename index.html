            <li>Nintendo 64</li>
            <li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
            <li>Released November 21, 1998</li>
            <li>The console and game itself was meant for my older siblings, but I quickly took ownership!</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Truly I became hooked, and at the age of 5, I pulled my first all nighter by sneaking out to the living room and playing</p>

         <p>When I was 11 years old, Halo 3 was released. This is still considered one of the biggest launches of a console/game to date. 
            While I was far too young to be standing outside waiting for a midnight release, I will never forget getting a new console for my birthday with this game.</p>
         <p>For a trip down memory lane, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-nH3xq6ozY">here</a> is a link to a launch event for the console and game</p>

         <ol>
            <li>The first game I beat completely on my own</li>
            <li>It wasnt recommended or a big popular title</li>
            <li>Just a curious kid figuring out how to get through an underwater dystopia</li>

         <h2>Why is it my favorite passion?</h2>
         <p>Gaming has helped me in life in so many ways. Its been an outlet that I can explore in the hardest of times. Not that it doesn't come with its own problems if abused, but it truly has helped shape me into who I am today.</p>
         <p>It's a great way to unwind, have fun! Or it can be used a tool for learning. It can even be used to look inward and understand what kind of person you are, or who you want to become!</p>
         <p>Learn from the mistakes of the characters you play as, or learn communication skills in team oriented games!</p>

         <h2>A Way to Keep in Contact</h2>

         <p>Recently even just moving to St.Louis, it can be hard keeping in contact with friends back in Texas. My friend group decided to give Dungeons and Dragons a shot, and now we play every sunday! Without knowing it, DnD has truly become my life! I look forward to playing every week. While this isn't my campaign, these three brothers playing have some pretty great moments.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQaZC24kiw">Here</a> is a funny moment only possible through games!</p>
